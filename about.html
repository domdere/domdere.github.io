<h2 id="me">Me</h2>
<p>I’m a Software Engineer, with an interest in Mathematics. As a Software Engineer, I’m a late adopter of Functional Programming. As a Mathematician, I’m a late adopter of Category Theory.</p>
<p>At this stage, I’m a wannabe Haskell afficianado.</p>
<h2 id="the-site">The Site</h2>
<p>When I began learning FP, there were many suitable looking places to start. <a href="http://www.learnyouahaskell.com" title="Learn You a Haskell For Great Good!"><strong>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</strong></a> was certainly a fun and engaging introduction to both FP and Haskell that managed to get across the benefits of the paradigm.</p>
<p>These days more and more beginner FP books are cropping up that go beyond where <em>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</em> stops.</p>
<p>After reading those, however, I didn’t really know where to go next with it. There’s all kinds of interesting research going on into the area, there’s a lot to learn that hasn’t found its way into books yet. So my main means of learning have been reading blogs and sifting through research papers. To this day I still find that even though I learn about advanced concepts, I’m still frequently surprised by really simple concepts that I come across that are completely new to me.</p>
<p>So I wish to catalogue the rest of my FP (primarily Haskell) learning experience on this site and try to organise the concepts I learn in some sort of order of increasing difficulty.</p>
<p>Plus it’ll probably help me get some misconceptions along the way corrected.</p>
